Introduction of the ExtensionBundle API.

* New ExtensionBundle APIs allow to bundle extensions into a single object for easier reuse. Supported extension
  hooks include directives, markup parser extensions, rewrite rules, custom renderers, document type matchers, 
  alternative parsers for stylesheets, templates or configuration headers and default templates per output format. 
  For migrating from 0.8 extension hooks, see <https://github.com/planet42/Laika/issues/56>.
* Reduced number of settings and tasks in the sbt plugin, by using the new ExtensionBundle API for sbt settings.
  The most common tasks and setting remain unchanged, for users of the lower level extension settings of the plugin 
  see <https://github.com/planet42/Laika/issues/65> for migration instructions.
* Improved package structure to reduce number of required imports. For simpler use cases a global "organize imports"
  should suffice for migration, for all other cases see <https://github.com/planet42/Laika/issues/66>. 
* The changes listed above fix some of the design issues of the very early releases from 2013/14 and bring the API 
  closer to the intended 1.0 API. Upcoming releases are expected to have a much lower number of breaking changes, 
  if any, as they are mostly feature additions.
