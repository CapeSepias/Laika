Major theme for this release is a complete redesign of the Document API.

* Support for Scala 2.12 (with continued support for 2.11 and 2.10)
* Redesign and cleanup of the Document API: use case classes wherever possible,
  extract features into pluggable traits and introduce a new Cursor type for tree rewriting
* Allow to customize the FopFactory for the PDF renderer (in API and sbt plugin)
* Fix an issue in the laika:site task in the sbt plugin that executed several sub-tasks
  twice which could lead to IllegalStateExceptions caused by the resulting race condition
* Fixes for the reStructuredText parser (for option lists and IP addresses)
