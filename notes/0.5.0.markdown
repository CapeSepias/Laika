Main focus for this release is a new sbt plugin for site generation.

New features and changes:

* [New sbt plugin](http://planet42.github.io/Laika/using-laika/sbt.html), exposing all Laika 
  features and customization hooks as sbt tasks and settings
* New option to merge multiple input directories into a tree structure with a single root,
  allowing to keep reusable styles or templates ("themes") separately
* New option to use Markdown and reStructuredText markup in the same input tree, including
  cross-linking between the two formats
* Move to a multi-project build and rename the main artifact from `laika` to `laika-core`
* Upgrade to ScalaTest 2.0 and sbt 0.13
* Drop support for Scala 2.9.x
