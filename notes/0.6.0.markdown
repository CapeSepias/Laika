Main focus of this release is support for PDF output.

New features and changes:

* Support for rendering PDF documents
* Support for rendering XSL-FO output
* New CSS parser supporting a large subset of standard CSS
* Support styling of PDF documents with CSS
* Support for different templates per output format
* New sbt tasks: `html`, `pdf`, `xslfo`, `prettyPrint` for rendering
  a single output format
* New sbt task `generate` for rendering one or more output formats
  (e.g. `laika:generate html pdf`)
* Integrate PDF output into existing sbt task `laika:site` via
  new setting `includePDF`
* New directives `pageBreak`, `style` and `format`
* Changes to the `Render` and `Transform` API to allow for the
  merging of an entire directory of input files into a single output
  file (as required by PDF rendering)
