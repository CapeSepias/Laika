Support for sbt 1.0.

* Laika's sbt plugin is now an AutoPlugin
* Prefixed all task and setting keys to adhere to recommended naming pattern
  (e.g. laikaGenerate)
* Adjustments for API changes in sbt 1.0
* Bug fixes in the library
* Drop support for sbt 0.13 and Scala 2.10

The unusual version number reflects the fact that users of the sbt plugin need
to update their build for the changes in the key names, while for users of
the library this release is a drop-in replacement containing only bug fixes.
