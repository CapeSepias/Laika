With this release both the Markdown and reStructuredText parsers are significantly more stable than
in the previous version, therefore an update is recommended for all users.

This version adds the following features and enhancements:

* Support for most of the standard directives and text roles of the reStructuredText reference
  parser (admonitions, `figure`, `image`, `code`, `raw` and many more)
* Now integrates the official Markdown test suite (any many fixes to make it pass)
* Now integrates a test for transforming the full reStructuredText specification (which
  is written in reStructuredText) and many fixes to make it pass
* Adds the renderer option `HTML.unformatted` for terse output without indentation or whitespace
  (often desirable when writing the rendered document to a database for example)
* Adds a new [Web Tool](http://www.planet42.org/laika/webtool) to try out Laika online
* General cleanup of parser implementations and alignments between Markdown and reStructuredText
  parsers, making both of them much more robust
  
With the core feature set now being polished, the emphasis for subsequent releases will now 
be on higher-level functionality like template-based site generation (0.4), an sbt-plugin (0.5), 
PDF export (0.6) and epub export (0.7).
