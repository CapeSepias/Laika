The speed release.

* Doubles parsing speed for both Markdown and reStructuredText
* Much lower number of parser instance creations on repeated runs
* Performance goals had been achieved through replacing the former
  Scala SDK parser combinators with a custom, optimized combinator design:
    * Fewer dependent types and base parsers in objects instead of traits, making it easier to freely compose parsers
    * Create parser error messages lazily, as most of them will never be accessed
    * Avoid cost of by-name args in all cases except | combinator
* Other changes in this release:
    * Add support for size and align options for the image directive in reStructuredText
    * Fixes for all bugs known and reported to this point 
    * Remove all deprecation warnings for Scala 2.12
