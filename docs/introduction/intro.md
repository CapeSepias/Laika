Laika
=====

Laika is a customizable and extensible toolkit for transforming lightweight text markup 
and template based site and e-book generation.

It has been designed for two primary usage scenarios:

* Embedded use (e.g. web applications that allow user input in one of the supported markup syntaxes)

* As a standalone tool (e.g. using Laika's sbt plugin to produce the project's documentation)

Laika does not require the installation of any external tools.

It is Open Source under the Apache 2.0 License.

If you wonder about the name of the project and have never heard about Laika, 
you can read about her [here][laika-wikipedia].

Getting Started
---------------

The current version is published to Maven Central for Scala 2.13, 2.12 and Scala.js 1.0.

The sbt plugin is published to the sbt plugin repository for sbt 1.x.

The final release for Scala 2.11 had been 0.10.0, 
the final release for Scala 2.10 and sbt 0.13 was 0.7.0.


### Using the sbt Plugin

Add the plugin to `project/plugins.sbt`:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.planet42" % "laika-sbt" % "0.14.0")
```

Enable the plugin in your project's `build.sbt`:

```scala
enablePlugins(LaikaPlugin)
```

Add Markdown, reStructuredText or HTML template files to `src/docs` in your
project and run the `laikaSite` task from within sbt to generate the site
in `target/docs/site`.    


### Using the Library API

If you are updating from a version before 0.12.0, it's recommended to read
the [Migration Guide](http://planet42.github.io/Laika/migration-guide-0.12.html) 
first, as there were significant changes in the Library API.

Adding the Laika dependency to your sbt build:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.planet42" %% "laika-core" % "0.14.0"
```

If you want to use Laika with Scala.js, use the standard triple-%:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.planet42" %%% "laika-core" % "0.14.0"
```

Note that only `laika-core` has been published for Scala.js, the `laika-io`
and `laika-pdf` modules are only available for the JVM.

Example for transforming Markdown to HTML:

```scala
import laika.api._
import laika.format._

val transformer = Transformer
  .from(Markdown)
  .to(HTML)
  .build
  
val res: Either[ParserError, String] = transformer
  .transform("hello *there*")
```


For file/stream IO, parallel processing and/or EPUB support, based on cats-effect, 
add the laika-io module to your build:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.planet42" %% "laika-io" % "0.14.0"  
```

Example for transforming an entire directory of markup files to a single EPUB file:

```scala
import laika.api._
import laika.format._
import laika.io.implicits._

implicit val cs: ContextShift[IO] = 
  IO.contextShift(ExecutionContext.global)
  
val blocker = Blocker.liftExecutionContext(
  ExecutionContext.fromExecutor(Executors.newCachedThreadPool())
)

val transformer = Transformer
  .from(Markdown)
  .to(EPUB)
  .using(GitHubFlavor)
  .io(blocker)
  .parallel[IO]
  .build
  
val res: IO[Unit] = transformer
  .fromDirectory("src")
  .toFile("hello.epub")
  .transform
```

When using Laika's PDF support you need to add one more dependency to your build:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.planet42" %% "laika-pdf" % "0.14.0"
```

The example for how to transform a directory of input files into a PDF file looks
the same as the EPUB example, apart from swapping `EPUB` for `PDF`

Release History
---------------

* __0.14.0__ (Feb 28, 2020):

    * Introduce support for Scala.js for the entire laika-core module:
        * Brings the complete functionality of Laika to Scala.js with the only
          exceptions being File/Stream IO and support for PDF and EPUB output
        * Eliminate the last, semi-hidden usages of Java reflection to enable Scala.js support
        * Avoid use of `java.time.Instant` in the shared base to not force another heavy dependency
          on Scala.js users
    * Laika's integrated syntax highlighting:
        * Add support for Dotty, JSX/TSX, SQL, EBNF, Laika's own AST format
    * Parser APIs:
        * Introduce `PrefixedParser` trait to make span parser optimizations implicit
          for 90% of the use cases and no longer require the developer to explicitly 
          supply a set of possible start characters for the span
        * Introduce new parser for delimiters that generalizes typical checks for preceding
          and following characters in markup parsers (e.g. `delimiter("**").prevNot(whitespace)`),
          to reduce boilerplate for inline parsers
        * Introduce shortcuts for very common usages of text parsers (e.g. `oneOf('a','b')` instead of
          `anyOf('a','b').take(1)`)
        * Expand the API of the `Parser` base trait: add `source` method for obtaining the consumed
          part of the input instead of the result of the parser, and `count` to obtain the number of
          consumed characters
        * Introduce `laika.parse.implicits._` for extension methods for common parsers, e.g.
          `.concat`, `mapN`.
        * Introduce shortcut for repeating a parser with a separator
        * Deprecate all APIs that relied on implicit conversions
        * Deprecate some of the rather cryptic symbol methods on `Parser` in favor of named methods
        * `DelimitedText` does no longer have a type parameter
    * AST changes and improvements:
        * Introduce RelativePath as a separate type in addition to the existing Path type
          which is now only used for absolute paths
        * Introduce a range of shortcut constructors for Laika's AST nodes, that allow you
          to write `Paragraph("some text")` instead of `Paragraph(Seq(Text("some text")))`
          for example
    * Directives:
        * Cleaner syntax for default attributes which are no longer part of the HOCON
          attribute block for named attributes
    * Demo App:
        * Cleanup from six to two (bigger) panels for improved usability
        * Use Laika's own syntax highlighting in the output
        * Allow to switch from JVM execution to Java.js
        * Move from Akka HTTP to http4s
        * Integrate source into Laika's main repository
    * Bugfix:
        * Syntax highlighting for interpolated strings in Scala was broken in 0.13.0
        * Fix a flaky test that relied on the ordering of HashMap entries
        

* __0.13.0__ (Jan 26, 2020):

    * Introduce integrated syntax highlighting based on the libraries own parsers
        * Resulting AST nodes for code spans are part of the document AST and
          can be processed or transformed like all other nodes
        * Works with any renderer, including PDF
        * Initially supported are Scala, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript,
          HTML, CSS, XML, JSON, HOCON
        * Convenient base parsers for common syntax like string and number literals
          or identifiers to facilitate development of new syntax highlighters
    * HOCON parser: add support for `include` statements, this final feature addition 
      makes Laika's HOCON support fully spec-compliant      
    * New transformation hooks in the `laika-io` module for parallel transformers: 
      `mapDocuments(Document => Document)`, `evalMapDocuments(Document => F[Document])` 
      and the corresponsing `mapTree` and `evalMapTree`
    * Transformer introspection: introduce `describe` method for parsers, renderers
      and transformers and `laikaDescribe` setting in the sbt plugin that provides
      formatted information about the transformer setup and installed extensions
    * sbt plugin: improved accuracy for caching logic for EPUB and PDF output
      that still works when the artifact name or version changes
    * Upgrade dependency on cats-core to 2.1.0

* __0.12.1__ (Dec 1, 2019):

    * Fixes and Improvements for the new HOCON parser introduced in version 0.12.0
        * Significant improvements for error messages in HOCON parser
        * Fixes for nested self references, missing optional self references,
          and objects without '=' or ':' separator
    * Parser Combinators: The '|' alternative parser now keeps the failure with the
      most processed characters and not the last one, for improved error messages
    * Fix for script tag with attributes not being recognized in verbatim HTML in Markdown

* __0.12.0__ (Oct 30, 2019):

    * New laika-io Module
        * Functionality extracted from existing laika-core module
        * Contains File/Stream IO, EPUB output, Parallel transformations
        * Based on cats-effect type classes (in "Bring-Your-Own-Effect" style) 
        * Leaves laika-core pure, preparing it for later support for Scala.js
    * Referential Transparency
        * No method in the public API throws Exceptions anymore
        * The result of pure operations is provided by instances of `Either`
        * The result of side-effecting operations is provided by a return type of `F[A]`,
          with `F[_]` being an effect type from cats-effect
        * Eliminated all uses of runtime reflection
    * Changes to the APIs for creating and running parsers, renderers and transformers
        * Necessary due to the changes listed above
        * See the migration guide for details and examples  
    * Changes to the Directive Syntax in Templating
        * The syntax of separators for the attribute and body sections have changed
        * HOCON syntax is now used for attributes
        * The old syntax is still supported, but will be removed at some point before the 1.0 release
    * Changes to the Directive DSL for creating directives
        * `attribute(Default)` is now `defaultAttribute`
        * `body` is now either `parsedBody` or `rawBody`
        * Type conversions happen with the new `as` method: `attribute("title").as[String]`,
          based on the `ConfigDecoder` type class that is also used for the new Config API
        * Named body parts have been replaced by the more flexible Separator Directives
        * The built-in helper for mapping directive parts with different arity has
          been replaced by cats' `mapN`
    * Refactoring of AST Rewrite API to be fully type-safe and avoid runtime reflection and exceptions.
        * Return types are now more explicit (e.g. `Replace(newSpan)` instead of `Some(newSpan)`)
        * Rules for rewriting spans and blocks get registered separately for increased
          type-safety, as it is invalid to replace a span with a block element.
    * Refactoring of the Render API to be referentially transparent
        * Also applies to the API for registering custom renderers for individual AST nodes
    * New Config API and built-in HOCON parser
        * Removed the dependency on the Typesafe Config library and its impure Java API
        * Added a new lightweight and pure HOCON parser as part of laika-core,
          supporting the full spec except for file includes (for now).
    * Enhancement for the DocumentTree API      
        * The result of a tree parsing operation is now a new type called `DocumentTreeRoot`
        * It has a `coverDocument` property and contains the recursive tree structure of the parsed content.
        * Each `DocumentTree` in the structure now has an explicit `titleDocument: Option[Document]` property
          for more explicit content organization in e-books.
        * Properties that previously held references to streams and other impure data had been
          removed from the pure content model (e.g. `DocumentTree.staticDocuments`). 
    * Bug fixes for fenced code blocks with blank lines in GitHub-Flavored Markdown

    * New ExtensionBundle APIs allow to bundle extensions into a single object for easier reuse. Supported extension
      hooks include directives, markup parser extensions, rewrite rules, custom renderers, document type matchers, 
      alternative parsers for stylesheets, templates or configuration headers and default templates per output format. 
    * Reduced number of settings and tasks in the sbt plugin, by using the new ExtensionBundle API for sbt settings.
    * Improved package structure to reduce number of required imports. 

* __0.8.0__ (June 4, 2018):

    * Doubles parsing speed for both Markdown and reStructuredText
    * Much lower number of parser instance creations on repeated runs
    * Performance goals had been achieved through replacing the former
      Scala SDK parser combinators with a custom, optimized combinator design:
        * Fewer dependent types and base parsers in objects instead of traits, making it easier to freely compose parsers
        * Create parser error messages lazily, as most of them will never be accessed
        * Avoid cost of by-name args in all cases except | combinator
