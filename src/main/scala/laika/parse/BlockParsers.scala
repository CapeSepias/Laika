/** A generic base trait for block parsers. Provides base parsers that abstract
 *  aspects of block parsing common to most lightweight markup languages.
 *  
 *  It contains simple parsers for parsing chunks that make up blocks (text
 *  lines, blank lines, etc.) as well as a convenient `block` helper parser
 *  that simplifies parsing of full blocks.
 *  
 *  The only abstract members are the `topLevelBlock` and `nestedBlock` parsers
 *  that the other parsers delegate to.
