/** Since there is no straightforward way to validate a rendered PDF document
 *  on the JVM, this Spec merely asserts that a file or OutputStream is non-empty
 *  after rendering. Most of the functionality for PDF rendering that Laika itself
 *  provides lies in its support for XSL-FO rendering and application of CSS to
 *  this render process. This functionality is extensively tested in other Specs.
 *  For the actual creation of the binary PDF format, Laika primarily relies
 *  on Apache FOP for converting the rendered XSL-FO to PDF, therefore having 
 *  limited scope in this particular spec is acceptable.
