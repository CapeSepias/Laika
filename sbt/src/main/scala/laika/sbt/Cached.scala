/** Modified version of sbt's `FileFunction` object that allows for a more fine grained change detection.
 *  In the original sbt implementation one set of input files was always mapped to one set of output files
 *  to determine if any of those have changed and the associated action should be run.
 *  
 *  In Laika's `generate` task the output formats can be specified dynamically on the command line and
 *  only the sets of output files that match the command should be considered when performing the change
 *  detection. The command `generate pdf html` for example should only look for changes in the input files
 *  and whether the output files in the targets for PDF and HTML are still present.
 *  
 *  This means that we have to map one set of input files to a variable number of sets of output files.
 *  If the input files have been modified, all output files will need to be regenerated. If only one set
 *  of output files has been deleted, only these will be regenerated.
