/** API for performing a transformation operation from and to various types of input and output,
 *  combining a parse and render operation. 
 *  
 *  In cases where a parse or render operation should
 *  be performed separately, for example for manually processing the document tree model
 *  between these operations, the [[laika.api.Parse]] and [[laika.api.Render]] APIs 
 *  should be used instead.
 *  
 *  Example for transforming from Markdown to HTML using files for both input and output:
 *  
 *  {{{
 *  Transform from Markdown to HTML fromFile "hello.md" toFile "hello.html"
 *  }}}
 *  
 *  Example for transforming an entire directory and its subdirectories:
 *  
 *  {{{
 *  Transform from Markdown to HTML fromDirectory "source" toDirectory "target"
 *  }}}
 *  
 *  Or for transforming a document fragment from a string to the PrettyPrint format
 *  for debugging purposes:
 *  
 *  {{{
 *  val input = "some *emphasized* text"
 *  
 *  Transform from Markdown to PrettyPrint fromString input toString
 *  
 *  res0: java.lang.String = 
 *  Document - Blocks: 1
 *  . Paragraph - Spans: 3
 *  . . Text - 'some ' 
 *  . . Emphasized - Spans: 1
 *  . . . Text - 'emphasized'
 *  . . Text - ' text'
 *  }}}
 *  
 *  Apart from specifying input and output, the Transform API also allows to customize the operation
 *  in various ways. The `usingRule` and `creatingRule` methods allow to rewrite the document tree
 *  between the parse and render operations and the `rendering` method allows to customize the
 *  way certain types of elements are rendered.
 *  
 *  @tparam W the writer API to use which varies depending on the renderer
 *

   *  directly, but if there is no need to otherwise access the document instance
   *  and just chain parse and render operations this hook is more convenient.
   *  
   *  The rule is a partial function that takes an `Element` and returns an `Option[Element]`.
   *  
   *  If the function is not defined for a specific element the old element remains
   *  in the tree unchanged. If it returns `None` then the node gets removed from the tree, 
   *  if it returns an element it will replace the old one. Of course the function may
   *  also return the old element.
   *  
   *  The rewriting is performed in a way that only branches of the tree that contain
   *  new or removed elements will be replaced. It is processed bottom-up, therefore
   *  any element container passed to the rule only contains children which have already
   *  been processed. 
   *

   *  directly, but if there is no need to otherwise access the document instance
   *  and just chain parse and render operations this hook is more convenient.
   *  
   *  The difference of this method to the `usingRule` method is that it expects a function
   *  that expects a Document instance and returns the rewrite rule. This way the full document
   *  can be queried before any rule is applied. This is necessary in cases where the rule
   *  (which gets applied node-by-node) depends on information from other nodes. An example
   *  from the built-in rewrite rules is the rule that resolves link references. To replace
   *  all link reference elements with actual link elements, the rewrite rule needs to know
   *  all LinkDefinitions the document tree contains.
   *  
   *  The rule itself is a partial function that takes an `Element` and returns an `Option[Element]`.
