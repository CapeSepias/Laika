/** An extension bundle is a collection of parser extensions, rewrite rules, render themes
  * and other features to be applied to parse, render and transform operations. It serves
  * as a central registry for all of Laika's extension and customization hooks.
  *
  * The base trait contains empty implementations for all these features, therefore any bundle
  * implementation only needs to override the relevant members.
  *
  * If the bundle implementation is not parameterized, the most convenient choice for users would
  * be to simply implement it as an object, like all built-in extensions do:
  *
  * {{{
  * object MyExtensions extends ExtensionBundle {
  *
  *   // override one or more members
  *
  * }
  * }}}
  *
  * This way a user can easily pass it to the operation builders:
  *
  * {{{
  * Transform
  *   .from(Markdown).to(HTML)
  *   .using(MyExtensions)
  *   .fromFile("hello.md").toFile("hello.html")
  * }}}
