/** Represents the output of a renderer, abstracting over various types of IO resources.

 *  funtion (`String => Unit`) is provided. Alternatively the full `java.io.Writer` API
 *  may be used.
 *  
 *  The API provided by this trait is only meant to be used internally by a renderer
 *  implementation. For providing hooks for user customization, the renderer should
 *  wrap it in a convenient API appropriate for the corresponding output format, like
 *  the `HTMLWriter` API for HTML renderers for example.
