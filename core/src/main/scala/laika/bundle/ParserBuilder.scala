/** Builds a parser definition lazily by passing the recursive parsers

  *
  * This indirection is needed when supplying parser implementations as
  * many parsers recursively parse child elements. A list parser for example
  * needs to be able to detect any other block or span element within a list
  * item. But since it has no way of knowing which extensions a user might
  * have added to the host language, those parsers are supplied from the
  * outside by the parser engine.
