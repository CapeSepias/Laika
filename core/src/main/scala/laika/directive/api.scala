  /**  Provides the basic building blocks for defining directives, Laika's extension
    *  mechanism for creating custom tags for both, templates or text markup.
    *
    *  This object is used as part of the concrete objects  `Blocks.dsl`,
    *  `Spans.dsl` and `Templates.dsl` respectively.
    *
    *  It contains several simple combinators that allow to specify the expected
    *  attributes and body elements of the directive, optional converters for these
    *  elements and the function responsible for producing the final node element.
    *
    *  In contrast to custom tag hooks in other template engines the result of
    *  a directive is not a string. In the same way as markup documents get
    *  transformed into a tree of elements before rendering, a directive produces
    *  a node of the tree to render. As a result, the directive can be used
    *  independent from the output format.
    *
    *  Entry points of the API are the `Templates`, `Blocks` and `Spans` objects for the
    *  three different directive types.
    *
    *  A directive may consist of any combination of arguments, fields and body elements:
    *
    *  {{{
    *  @:myDirective arg1=value1 arg2=value2: {
    *    This is the body of the directive. It may consist of any standard or custom
    *    block-level and inline markup.
    *  }
    *  }}}
    *
    *  In the example above `arg1` and `arg2` are arguments, ollowed by a body element
    *  enclosed in curly braces.
    *
    *  For each of these directive elements, the API offers a combinator to specify whether the
    *  element is required or optional, and an optional function to convert or validate the
    *  parsed value.
    *
    *  Consider the following simple example of a directive with just one argument and
    *  a body, for specifying a specially formatted inline note:
    *
    *  {{{
    *  @:note This is the title: { This is the body of the note. }
    *  }}}
    *
    *  The implementation of this directive could look like this:
    *
    *  {{{
    *  case class Note (title: String, content: Seq[Span], options: Options = NoOpt)
    *                                                      extends Span with SpanContainer[Note]
    *
    *  object MyDirectives extends DirectiveRegistry {
    *    val spanDirectives = Seq(
    *      Spans.create("note") {
    *        (attribute(Default) ~ body(Default)).map { 
    *          case title ~ content => Note(title, content) 
    *        }
    *      }
    *    )
    *    val blockDirectives = Seq()
    *  }
    *
    *  Transformer.from(Markdown).to(HTML).using(MyDirectives) fromFile "hello.md" toFile "hello.html"
    *  }}}
    *
    *  The `attribute(Default)` combinator specifies a required attribue of type `String` (since no conversion
    *  function was supplied) and without a name (indicated by passing the `Default` object instead of a string
    *  name). The `body` combinator specifies standard inline content (any span
    *  elements that are supported in normal inline markup, too) which results in a parsed value of type
    *  `Seq[Span]`.
    *
    *  Finally you need to provide a function that accepts the results of the specified
    *  directive elements as parameters (of the corresponding type). Here we created a case class
    *  with a matching signature so can pass it directly as the target function. For a span directive
    *  the final result has to be of type `Span` which the `Note` class satisfies. Finally the directive
    *  gets registered with the `Markdown` parser. It can be registered for a `reStructuredText` parser,
    *  too, without any changes.
    *
    *  If any conversion or validation is required on the individual parts of the directive they can
    *  be passed to the corresponding function:
    *
    *  {{{
    *  case class Message (severity: Int,
    *                      content: Seq[Block],
    *                      options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block
    *                                                with BlockContainer[Message]
    *
    *  val blockDirectives = Seq(
    *    Blocks.create("message") {
    *      (attribute(Default, positiveInt) ~ blockContent).map { 
    *        case severity ~ content => Message(severity, content) 
    *      }
    *    }
    *  )
    *  }}}
    *
    *  In the example above the built-in `positiveInt` converter gets passed to the `attribute`
    *  combinator, but you can easily create and use your own functions.
    *  The function has to accept a string argument and return a `Result[T]`.
    *
    *  The `Failure` subtype of `Result` will be interpreted as an error by the interpreter with the string being used as the message
    *  and an instance of `InvalidBlock` containing the validator message and the raw source of the directive
    *  will be inserted into the document tree. In this case the final function (`Message`) will never be invoked.
    *
    *  The `Success` subtype of `Result` will be used as an argument to the final function. Note how the case class now expects
    *  an `Int` as the first parameter.
    *
    *  Finally attributes and body elements can also be optional. In case they are missing, the directive is still
    *  considered valid and `None` will be passed to your function:
    *
    *  {{{
    *  case class Message (severity: Int,
    *                      content: Seq[Block],
    *                      options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block
    *                                                with BlockContainer[Message]
    *
    *  val blockDirectives = Seq(
    *    Blocks.create("message") {
    *      (attribute(Default, positiveInt).optional ~ blockContent).map { 
    *        case severity ~ content => Message(severity.getOrElse(0), content) 
    *      }
    *    }
    *  )
    *  }}}
    *
    *  The attribute may be missing, but if it is present it has to pass the specified validator.
