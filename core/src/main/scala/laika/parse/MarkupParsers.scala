/** Base parsers that provide optimized low-level renderers for typical requirements
 *  of text markup parsers. In particular they are meant as an efficient replacement
 *  for scenarios where usually regex parsers are used. In cases where different parsers
 *  need to be tried for relatively short input sequences, regex parsers tend to be less
 *  efficient. Furthermore, these base parsers may also improve readability, as it
 *  allows to combine simple low-level parsers to higher-level parsers based on the
 *  Scala SDK combinator API, instead of producing long regexes which may be hard to read.
