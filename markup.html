    <h1>Supported Markup</h1>
  </div>
  <p>The initial release only supports Markdown. But at least two further formats are planned
  for subsequent releases: restructuredText and &quot;Markmore&quot;, the working title of a new
  format of extended Markdown syntax, inspired by existing extensions like those from
  GitHub, kramdown or Pandoc, with the overall goal of trying to marry the clarity and
  simplicity of Markdown with the power of reStructuredText.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless this document only covers the language available today, which is Markdown.</p>
  <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
  <p>Laika supports Markdown as the first lightweight text markup language primarily due to its popularity.
  It has several advantages, mainly that it is very easy to learn, very lightweight, and produces
  documents which are fairly good to read, even when you don&apos;t know anything about Markdown. 
  The popularity is probably largely based on these characteristics and is well deserved.</p>
  <p>However, Markdown also has its problems. First, it is not well defined. There is no real specification,
  only a &quot;syntax description&quot; that leaves many questions unanswered. Secondly, it is not extremely
  powerful, it has enough basic elements to support applications like a bugtrackers, blogs or forums, but it lacks
  features for more advanced usage like writing technical documentation or entire books. As a consequence
  extensions have been added to almost every Markdown implementation without much agreement between 
  them. Finally, the Markdown syntax itself tries to circumvent the reduced set of features through
  recommending the embedding of verbatim HTML elements for any formatting needs not supported by Markdown, 
  which is a somewhat problematic approach as we&apos;ll discuss further below.</p>
  
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>Even if you do not know much about Markdown formally, it is very likely that you have already used it.
  This document is not going to provide a syntax overview and refer to the official documentation instead.
  It will primarily focus on anything specific to the way Laika handles Markdown.</p>
  <p>To get an overview over Markdown syntax, these documents may be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>For a description of  <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">official syntax documentation</a>.</p></li>
    <li><p>For trying out small snippets of Markdown and checking how the various existing Markdown implementations
    handle them, the [Babelmark] tool can be used.<br></p></li>
    <li><p>For using Markdown in Laika, the [Transformation Basics] page should answer most of your questions.</p></li>
    <li><p>For the special treatment of verbatim HTML in Laika, see the following section.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Laika tries to follow the official syntax documentation. In cases where it is silent on how
  to handle certain edge cases, the Babelmark tool has been consulted and usually the approach
  the majority of available parses have chosen has been picked for Laika, too. There is currently only
  one (known) minor exception: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Laika does not detect a header if it is not preceded by a blank line. Supporting this would be
    disadvantageous for three reasons: it feels to be against the Markdown design goal of promoting
    readability, it would slow down the parser as there&apos;d need to be a lookahead to the next line
    for each line of a regular paragraph, and finally it&apos;ll open the doors for accidental headers.
    According to Babelmark, there are at least two parsers (Pandoc, Python-Markdown) that agree.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Verbatim HTML</h3>
  <p>Finally there is one major difference to standard Markdown: the parsing of verbatim HTML elements
  is not enabled by default, but it can be configured if required. Before showing how to do that,
  this section explains this design decision.</p>
  <p>The problems with enabling verbatim HTML elements by default would be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>It goes against Markdown&apos;s own design goal of great readability, and of being easy for anyone
    to pick up. Markdown syntax basics can be understood in minutes, by non-technical people, but producing well-formed
    and valid HTML is not trivial if you do not regularly deal with HTML.</p></li>
    <li><p>It goes against Laika&apos;s design goal of decoupling parsers and renderers. Allowing verbatim
    HTML elements really only makes sense if the output format is HTML, too. Once Laika adds
    output formats like PDF, it would be unclear what these renderers should do with these elements.
    Markdown was designed with only HTML output in mind, so this mismatch is natural.</p></li>
    <li><p>It would not be safe to use without additional filtering when used in web applications
    that offer user input. Before rendering some processing based on whitelists would need
    to be performed to avoid security vulnerabilities. Laika makes it easy to add such
    whitelist functionality through document tree rewriting.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This design decision has the following consequences for the Laika library:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>The Markdown parser, by default, treats HTML tags as normal text input and converts
    tags to HTML entities when rendering, so that they would show up as part of the
    rendered text nodes in the final HTML document. How to enable HTML parsing is shown 
    further below.</p></li>
    <li><p>The elements nodes produced by the Markdown HTML parsers are not part of the standard
    Laika document tree model. Instead they are kept in a Markdown-specific trait <code>VerbatimHTMLElements</code>.</p></li>
    <li><p>As a consequence, built-in renderers like that for HTML do not know these nodes. How to add
    the required renderer extensions will be shown below, too.</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This all sounds more complicated than it actually is. To enable verbatim HTML elements
  you have to change this standard expression:</p>
  <pre>Transform from Markdown to HTML
</pre>
  <p>to</p>
  <pre>Transform from (Markdown withVerbatimHTML) to (HTML using VerbatimHTML)
</pre>
  <p>This installs both, the required parser and renderer extensions.</p>
  <p>But, as explained above, when using this in a web application it is strongly recommended
  to add whitelist filtering. Per default Laika renders all HTML tags out as is, including
  orphaned opening and closing tags (without matching tag) and tags like <a href="mailto:script">mailto:script</a>.
  Whitelist functionality can be quickly added with a few lines of code using
  [Document Tree Rewriting].</p>
