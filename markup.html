    <h1>Supported Markup</h1>
  </div>
  <p>The current release supports Markdown and reStructuredText. Both implementations stay as close
  as possible to the original descriptions and specifications of these formats. The markup
  gets parsed into a generic document tree model shared between all parsers. This means
  that there are some adjustments in terminology (e.g. a bullet list in reStructuredText
  is called an &quot;unordered list&quot; in the Markdown syntax description). It also means that
  there are some tree element types which are not produced by the Markdown parser, like
  table, footnotes or citations, as reStructuredText is much more feature-rich than
  the original Markdown syntax. The unified model allows to create renderers that
  do not have to deal with any of the specifics of an individual markup syntax.</p>
  <h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>
  <p>Laika supports Markdown primarily due to its popularity.
  It has several advantages, mainly that it is very easy to learn, very lightweight, and produces
  documents which are fairly easy to read, even when you don&#39;t know anything about Markdown.</p>
  <p>However, Markdown also has a few issues. First, there is no real specification,
  only a page with a syntax description that leaves many questions unanswered. Secondly, its feature
  set is fairly limited, lacking functionality for more advanced usage like technical 
  documentation or entire books. As a consequence
  extensions have been added to almost every Markdown implementation without much agreement between 
  them. Finally, the Markdown syntax itself tries to circumvent the reduced set of features through
  recommending the embedding of verbatim HTML elements for any formatting needs not supported by Markdown, 
  which is not the best approach for a toolkit like Laika that aims to support other output formats
  than just HTML.</p>
  <p>Laika fully passes the official Markdown Test Suite. These tests are integrated into the Laika test suite.</p>
  
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>Even if you do not know much about Markdown formally, it is very likely that you have already used it.
  This document is not going to provide a syntax overview and refers to the official documentation instead.
  It will primarily focus on anything specific to the way Laika handles Markdown.</p>
  <p>To get an overview over Markdown syntax, these documents may be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>For a description of the syntax see the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">official syntax documentation</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For trying out small snippets of Markdown and checking how the various existing Markdown implementations
      handle them, the <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/babelmark2/">Babelmark</a> tool can be used.<br></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For using Markdown in Laika, the <a href="basics.html">Transformation Basics</a> page should answer most of your questions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>For the special treatment of verbatim HTML in Laika, see the following section.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Laika tries to follow the official syntax documentation. In cases where it is silent on how
  to handle certain edge cases, the Babelmark tool has been consulted and usually the approach
  the majority of available parses have chosen has been picked for Laika, too. There is currently only
  one (known) minor exception: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Laika does not detect a header if it is not preceded by a blank line. Supporting this would be
    disadvantageous for three reasons: it goes against Markdown&#39;s design goal of promoting
    readability, it would slow down the parser and it would open the doors for accidental headers.
    According to Babelmark, there are at least two parsers (Pandoc, Python-Markdown) that agree.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Verbatim HTML</h3>
  <p>Finally there is one major difference to standard Markdown: the parsing of verbatim HTML elements
  is not enabled by default, but it can be switched on if required. This decision is based on the 
  following problems with verbatim HTML:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>It goes against Markdown&#39;s own design goal of great readability and being easy for anyone
      to pick up. Markdown syntax basics can be understood in minutes, by non-technical people, 
      but producing well-formed and valid HTML is not trivial if you do not regularly deal with HTML.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It goes against Laika&#39;s design goal of decoupling parsers and renderers. 
      Markdown was designed with only HTML output in mind, so this mismatch is natural.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>It would not be safe to use without additional filtering when used in web applications
      that offer user input. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This design decision has the following consequences for the Laika toolkit:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The Markdown parser, by default, treats HTML tags as normal text input and converts
      tags to HTML entities when rendering, so that they would show up as part of the
      rendered text nodes in the final HTML document. How to enable HTML parsing is shown 
      further below.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The elements produced by the Markdown HTML parsers are not part of the standard
      Laika document tree model. Instead they are kept in a Markdown-specific trait <code>VerbatimHTMLElements</code>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>As a consequence, built-in renderers like that for HTML do not know these nodes. How to add
      the required renderer extensions will be shown below, too.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This all sounds more complicated than it actually is. To enable verbatim HTML elements
  you have to change this standard expression:</p>
  <pre>Transform from Markdown to HTML
</pre>
  <p>to</p>
  <pre>Transform from (Markdown withVerbatimHTML) to HTML rendering VerbatimHTML
</pre>
  <p>This installs both, the required parser and renderer extensions.</p>
  <p>But, as explained above, when using this in a web application it is strongly recommended
  to add whitelist filtering. Per default Laika renders all HTML tags out as is, including
  orphaned opening and closing tags (without matching tag) and tags like <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>.
  Whitelist functionality can be quickly added with a few lines of code using
  <a href="tree-rewriting.html">Document Tree Rewriting</a>.</p>
  <h2 id="rst">reStructuredText</h2>
  <p>The reStructuredText project is part of Python&#39;s Docutils project. It is considerably more feature-rich
  than Markdown, with support for tables, citations and footnotes. It is also extensible through
  directives and text roles, allowing the creation of custom block and span types without touching the
  original parser. Finally it is more strictly defined than Markdown, with a detailed specification
  and clearly defined markup recognition rules.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, adoption is not nearly as high as for Markdown, and some of the syntax is more
  verbose and less intuitive or legible than Markdown.</p>
  <p>Apparently there is no official test suite for reStructuredText, therefore to add a realistic
  test to the Laika test suite a full transformation of the reStructuredText specification itself
  is integrated into Laika&#39;s test suite. </p>
  
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>This document is not going to provide a syntax overview and refers to the official documentation instead.</p>
  <p>To get started with reStructuredText, these resources may be used:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html">official markup specification</a>.</p>
    </li>

      <p><a href="basics.html">Transformation Basics</a> for using reStructuredText in Laika.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The following sections below for an overview on how to implement extensions for reStructuredText</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Support for Standard Directives and TextRoles</h3>
  <p>The Python reference parser supports a number of directives and text roles out of the box, and Laika
  offers implementations for most of them. They are all registered by the default <code>ReStructuredText</code>
  parser instance so that you only have to explicitly register any further custom extensions.</p>
  <p>For a detailed specification of these standard extensions, see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Specification of the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html">standard directives</a> - including both block level directives
      and span directives to be used in substitution references.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Specification of the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/roles.html">standard text roles</a>.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Laika fully supports the following directives:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Admonitions: <code>attention</code>, <code>caution</code>, <code>danger</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>hint</code>, <code>important</code>,
    <code>note</code>, <code>tip</code>, <code>warning</code> and the generic <code>admonition</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Quotations: <code>epigraph</code>, <code>highlights</code> and <code>pull-quote</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>compound</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>container</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>topic</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>sidebar</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>rubric</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>parsed-literal</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>table</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>replace</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following directives are supported with some limitations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>figure</code> and <code>image</code> do not support the various layout options (<code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, <code>scale</code>, <code>align</code>), 
    as no other tree nodes in Laika carry concrete layout information. It is recommended to use styles instead.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>code</code> does currently not support syntax highlighting 
    (it allows to set the language though, so client-side highlighters can be integrated if required).</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>raw</code> does not support the <code>file</code> or <code>url</code> options (multi-file transformations are planned for version 0.4). </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>unicode</code>: does not support the various trim options, as that would require modifying adjacent elements
    (and no other directive has this requirement, therefore API/implementation changes did not seem justified)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>date</code>: Uses the patterns of <code>java.text.SimpleDateFormat</code> instead of Python&#39;s <code>time.strftime</code> function.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Support for the following directives is deferred to the 0.4 release as that will add support for template based
  site generation and the corresponding addition of features like logic for the generation of tables of content
  will make the implementation of these directives easier:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>contents</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>sectnum</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>header</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>footer</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>title</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>meta</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>include</code></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following standard text roles are fully supported:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>emphasis</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>strong</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>literal</code></li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>subscript</code> (and <code>sub</code> alias)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>superscript</code> (and <code>sup</code> alias)</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>title-reference</code> (and <code>title</code> alias) - the default role</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>raw</code> (+ format option)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following extensions are not supported:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>math</code>, <code>csv-table</code>, <code>list-table</code>, <code>target-notes</code> and <code>class</code> directives </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li><code>math</code>, <code>pep-reference</code> and <code>rfc-reference</code> text roles</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There are various reasons for excluding these extensions, some of them being rather technical.
  For example, the <code>target-notes</code> and <code>class</code> directives would require processing beyond the 
  directive itself, therefore would require new API. Others, like the <code>pep-reference</code> text role,
  seamed to exotic to warrant inclusion in Laika.</p>
  <p>Finally some of the defaults for these extensions can be changed through the API:</p>
  <pre>ReStructuredText.withRawContent
</pre>
  <p>enables both the <code>raw</code> directive and the <code>raw</code> text role. They are disabled by default as
  they present a potential security risk.</p>
  <pre>ReStructuredText.withDefaultTextRole(&quot;my-role-name&quot;)
</pre>
  <p>sets the text role <code>my-role-name</code> as the default role.</p>
  
  <h3>Extending reStructuredText</h3>
  <p>In contrast to Markdown reStructuredText has been designed to be extensible.
  The way these extension mechanisms are defined means that in most cases there
  is no need to provide custom low-level parser logic, but instead use the Laika
  API to specify the expected format based on existing building blocks the parser
  already knows how to deal with and then provide one or more functions to convert 
  and validate the parsed result and provide a tree element to be inserted into the document
  as a block or span element.</p>
  <p>The following types of extension points exist:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Block Directives - an extension hook for adding new block level elements to
      reStructuredText markup. 
      For details see the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#directives">specification entry for directives</a>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Substitution Definitions - an extension hook for adding new span level elements to
      reStructuredText markup that can be used by substitution references (like <code>|replaceMe|</code>). 
      For details see the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#substitution-definitions">specification entry for substitution definitions</a>. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Interpreted Text Roles - an extension hook for adding new dynamic span level elements to
      reStructuredText markup. In contrast to substitution definitions the implementation of a text
      role uses the text from the occurrences in the markup referring to the role as input.
      For details see the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#custom-interpreted-text-roles">specification entry for interpreted text roles</a>. </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Laika APIs for all of these extension types are explained in the sections below.</p>
  <p>The design of these APIs did not aim to mimic the API of the original Python reference implementation.
  Instead the goal was to create an API that is idiomatic Scala, fully typesafe and as concise as possible.
  Yet it should be flexible enough to semantically support the options of the Python directives and text roles, 
  so that ideally most existing Python directives could theoretically get ported to Laika.</p>
  <p>The style of the API is somewhat similar to the <a href="http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/ScalaJsonCombinators">Play JSON API</a> and its combinators. 
  It is inspired by the concepts outlined by Sadek Drobi in his 
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/sadache/3646092">document about functional builders</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>Implementing a Directive</h3>
  <p>A directive can be used to introduce new syntax for custom block or span elements.
  Entry points are the <code>BlockDirective</code> and <code>SpanDirective</code> objects. The Python reference parser does
  not make this distinction on the API level, but does this internally based on the context a 
  directive is parsed in. Since Laika APIs are typesafe, the distinction is necessary since
  block level and span level directives create different types of document tree nodes.
  A <code>SpanDirective</code> can only be used in a substitution definition which can then be used
  within flow elements. A <code>BlockDirective</code> can be used directly in any location other block
  level content like paragraphs or lists can be used.</p>
  <p>A directive may consist of any combination of arguments, fields and body elements:</p>
  <pre>.. myDirective:: arg1 arg2
  :field1: value1
  :field2: value2

  This is the body of the directive. It may consist of any standard or 
  custom block-level and inline markup.</pre>
  <p>In the example above <code>arg1</code> and <code>arg2</code> are arguments, <code>field1</code> and <code>field2</code> are fields,
  and followed by body elements after a blank line. If there are no arguments or fields
  the blank line may be omitted.</p>
  <p>For each of these directive elements, the API offers a method to specify whether the
  element is required or optional, and an optional function to convert or validate the
  parsed value.</p>
  <p>Consider the following simple example of a directive with just one argument and
  a body:</p>
  <pre>.. note:: This is the title

   This is the body of the note.</pre>
  <p>The implementation of this directive could look like this:</p>
  <pre>case class Note (title: String, 
                 content: Seq[Block], 
                 options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block 
                                           with BlockContainer[Note]

val rst = ReStructuredText withBlockDirectives
  BlockDirective(&quot;note&quot;) {
    (argument(withWS = true) ~ blockContent)(Note(_,_))
  }

Transform from rst to HTML fromFile &quot;hello.rst&quot; toFile &quot;hello.html&quot;</pre>
  <p>The <code>argument()</code> method specifies a required argument of type <code>String</code> (since no conversion
  function was supplied). We need to set the <code>withWS</code> flag to true as an argument cannot have
  whitespace per default. The <code>blockContent</code> method specifies standard block content (any block-level
  elements that are supported in normal blocks, too) which results in a parsed value of type
  <code>Seq[Block]</code>. Finally you need to provide a function that accepts the results of the specified
  directive elements as parameters (of the corresponding type). Here we created a case class
  with a matching signature (ignoring the optional third argument). For a block directive
  the final result has to be of type <code>Block</code> which the <code>Note</code> class satisfies. Finally the directive 
  gets registered with the <code>ReStructuredText</code> parser.</p>
  <p>If any conversion or validation is required on the individual parts of the directive they can
  be passed to the corresponding function:</p>
  <pre>def nonNegativeInt (value: String) =
  try {
    val num = value.toInt
    Either.cond(num &gt;= 0, num, &quot;not a positive int: &quot; + num)
  }
  catch {
    case e: NumberFormatException =&gt; Left(&quot;not a number: &quot; + value)
  }

case class Message (severity: Int, 
                    content: Seq[Block],
                    options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block 
                                              with BlockContainer[Message]

val rst = ReStructuredText withBlockDirectives
  BlockDirective(&quot;message&quot;) {
    (argument(nonNegativeInt) ~ blockContent)(Message(_,_))
  }</pre>
  <p>The function has to provide an <code>Either[String, T]</code> as a result. A <code>Left</code> result will be interpreted
  as an error by the parser with the string being used as the message and an instance of <code>InvalidBlock</code>
  containing the validator message and the raw source of the directive will be inserted into the document
  tree. In this case the final function (<code>Message</code>) will never be invoked. A <code>Right</code> result will be
  used as an argument to the final function. Note how this case class now expects an <code>Int</code> as the first
  parameter.</p>
  <p>Finally arguments and fields can also be optional. In case they are missing, the directive is still
  considered valid and <code>None</code> will be passed to your function:</p>
  <pre>case class Message (severity: Option[Int], 
                    content: Seq[Block],
                    options: Options = NoOpt) extends Block 
                                              with BlockContainer[Message]

val rst = ReStructuredText withBlockDirectives
  BlockDirective(&quot;message&quot;) {
    (optArgument(nonNegativeInt) ~ blockContent)(Message(_,_))
  }
</pre>
  <p>The argument may be missing, but if it is present it has to pass the specified validator.</p>
  <p>In case of multiple arguments, the order you specify them is also the order in which they
  are parsed from the directive markup, with the only exception being that required arguments
  will always be parsed before optional ones, and arguments with whitespace need to come last.</p>
  
  <h3>Implementing a Text Role</h3>
  <p>Text roles are the extension mechanism for inline elements of reStructuredText.
  For details see the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#custom-interpreted-text-roles">specification entry for interpreted text roles</a>.</p>
  <p>Entry point for creating a new role is the <code>TextRole</code> object. It allows to specify the following
  aspects that define a text role:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The name with which it can be referred to by both, a span of interpreted text and a role
      directive to further customize it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The default value, that should get passed to the role function in case it is used
      directly in interpreted text without customization through a role directive.</p>

    <li>
      <p>The role directive that specifies how the role can be customized. The options
      for role directives are almost identical to regular directives, the only difference
      being that role directives do not support arguments, only fields and body elements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The actual role function. It gets invoked for each occurrence of interpreted text
      that refers to this role, either directly by name or to the name of a role directive
      that customized this role. The first argument is either the default value
      or the result of the role directive, the second is the actual text of the interpreted 
      text span. The return value of the role function is the actual <code>Span</code> instance
      that the original interpreted text should be replaced with.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>A role directive may consist of any combination of fields and body elements:</p>
  <pre>.. role:: ticket(link)
  :base-url: http://www.company.com/tickets/</pre>
  <p>In the example above <code>ticket</code> is the name of the customized role, <code>link</code> the name
  of the base role and <code>base-url</code> the value that overrides the default defined in the
  base role.</p>
  <p>Before such a role directive can be used, an implementation has to be provided
  for the base role with the name <code>link</code>. For more details on implementing directives
  see the previous section.</p>
  <p>The implementation of the <code>link</code> text role could look like this:</p>
  <pre>val rst = ReStructuredText withTextRoles (
  TextRole(&quot;link&quot;, &quot;http://www.company.com/main/&quot;)(field(&quot;base-url&quot;)) {
    (base, text) =&gt; Link(List(Text(text)), base + text)
  }
)

Transform from rst to HTML fromFile &quot;hello.rst&quot; toFile &quot;hello.html&quot;   </pre>
  <p>We specify the name of the role to be <code>link</code>, and the default value the URL provided as the
  second argument. The second parameter list specifies the role directive implementation,
  in this case only consisting of a call to <code>field(&quot;base-url&quot;)</code> which specifies a required 
  field of type <code>String</code> (since no conversion function was supplied). The type of the result
  of the directive has to match the type of the default value.
  Finally the role function is defined that accepts two arguments. The first is the base
  url, either the default in case the base role is used directly, or the value specified
  with the <code>base-url</code> field in a customized role. The second is the actual text from the
  interpreted text span. In this case we use these values to create an instance of <code>Link</code>,
  a tree node from the default document tree. Finally the directive gets registered with 
  the <code>ReStructuredText</code> parser.</p>
  <p>If you need to define more fields or body content they can be added with the <code>~</code> combinator
  just like with normal directives. Likewise you can specify validators and converters for 
  fields and body values like documented above.</p>
  <p>Our example role can then be used in the following ways:</p>
  <p>Using the base role directly:</p>
  <pre>For details read our :link:`documentation`.</pre>
  <p>This would result in the following HTML:</p>
  <pre>For details read our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.company.com/main/documentation&quot;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
  <p>Using the customized role called <code>ticket</code>: </p>
  <pre>For details see ticket :ticket:`344`.</pre>
  <p>This would result in the following HTML:</p>
  <pre>For details see ticket &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.company.com/ticket/344&quot;&gt;344&lt;/a&gt;.</pre>
